* Confirm alert generation and dashboard visibility
* Troubleshoot firewall and connectivity issues

The goal of this phase is to establish a **stable monitoring foundation** that accurately simulates log collection and centralized visibility within a SOC environment.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project intentionally focuses on **infrastructure deployment and log pipeline validation**. Advanced detection engineering, attack simulation, and incident investigation will be addressed in subsequent SOC lab projects.
---
## 3. Lab Architecture

The SOC lab is deployed within a **virtualized environment** to simulate a simplified internal enterprise network. The architecture separates the **monitoring server** and the **endpoint**, reflecting a realistic centralized logging model.

### Lab Components

| Component                         | Role in the Lab                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host Machine (VMware Workstation) | Runs and manages all virtual machines                                     |
| Ubuntu Server (SOC Node)          | Centralized SIEM server for log collection, processing, and visualization |
| Kali Linux (Monitored Endpoint)   | Generates system and security events forwarded to the SIEM                |
| NAT Virtual Network               | Provides isolated internal subnet with internet access                    |
| Wazuh (All-in-One Deployment)     | Log collection, indexing (OpenSearch), detection engine, and dashboard    |

---

### Architectural Flow

The **Ubuntu Server** acts as the centralized SOC node where the **Wazuh Manager**, **Indexer**, and **Dashboard** are deployed in **all-in-one mode** to conserve system resources.

The **Kali Linux VM** functions as a monitored endpoint. Logs generated on this system are collected by the **Wazuh agent** and securely forwarded to the manager.

<img src="screenshots/ubuntu/Architecture_Flow.png" width="800">

---

### Architectural Design Considerations

This architecture was intentionally designed to:

* Operate within limited hardware resources (4GB SOC VM RAM)
* Maintain isolation from the external network
* Simulate centralized log aggregation
* Support realistic endpoint onboarding workflows
* Provide clear visibility into log ingestion and alert generation

This design establishes the **foundational monitoring layer** of the SOC lab. Detection engineering, attack simulation, and multi-endpoint expansion will be implemented in future phases of the project series.

---

#### 4. Network Configuration

All virtual machines in this SOC lab are configured using **NAT networking mode** within VMware Workstation. This ensures that each VM resides within the same internal virtual subnet while maintaining outbound internet access through the host machine.
